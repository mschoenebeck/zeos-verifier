# ZEOS SNARK Verifier

This is the [vCPU](https://liquidapps.io/vcpu) handler of the [ZEOS Token Contract](https://github.com/mschoenebeck/thezeostoken) to verify zk-SNARKs.

## Description
This JavaScript handler ('zeos_verify_proof.js') is the vCPU handler of the [ZEOS Token Contract](https://github.com/mschoenebeck/thezeostoken). It supports zk-SNARK verification for both: The [Groth16](https://electriccoin.co/blog/bellman-zksnarks-in-rust/) proving system as well as [Halo2](https://zcash.github.io/halo2/index.html).

This contract issues the ZEOS tokens as well as all zAsset token types that will be added to the protocol in the future. This contract features the 'verifyproof' action which verfies zk-SNARKs. It currently supports the [Groth16](https://electriccoin.co/blog/bellman-zksnarks-in-rust/) proving system as well as [Halo2](https://zcash.github.io/halo2/index.html). The 'verifyproof' action depends on the [vCPU](https://liquidapps.io/vcpu) service of LiquidApps. Check out the [ZEOS Verifier](https://github.com/mschoenebeck/zeos-verifier) to learn more about the vCPU module this contract depends on.

This contract is built on [EOSIO](https://eos.io/) and [Liquidapps' DAPP Network](https://liquidapps.io/) services.
